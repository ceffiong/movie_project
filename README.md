# About project
 This is a movie project using Python flask, js, css, html5, bootstrap framework. No backend databased, only a local json file as a db. 

## The following operations are persisted:
1. Adding a new movie
2. Updating a movie

## Delete operating is not persisted. 

I created this project in order to demonstrate a dynamic web application to Software Engineering Students at Masterschool. 

The project is meant to show what's possible with Python Flask/HTML/CSS. Also to serve as something for them to look forward to.
